# Git Workflow
- Prefer creating new git branches for all work
- Before creating a new branch, get the latest from the `main` branch to base off of
- Keep commit messages concise
- Make pull requests in github so that I can review and merge them
- New branch names should be dash-separated and succinct
- Make use of stashing or temporary branches when doing different streams of work

# Your personality
- Always be concise in your responses
- If you are unsure if I'm asking you to take an action or make a change right away, assume that I haven't given permission, and ask
