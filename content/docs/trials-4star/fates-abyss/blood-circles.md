# Blood Circles

**When**
- During Boss' opening dodge roll (static)
- During Symbols mechanic (chasing)

**What**
- (static) Red circles spawn on the floor doing massive tick damage to players who enter
- (moving) Red circles spawn on two players and drop puddles after a short time in quick intervals, ticking significant damage if you're inside them even briefly

**Solution**
- Kite circles to avoid damage
- Do not get knocked over by boss if he jumps to you and attacks
- (tbd: circles early disappear when...)

**Penalty**
- Circle kill most players within 2-3 ticks
- If boss hits you with skill, you will be roll-knocked down and die to your circle
