**What**
- The tile becomes fractured

**Solution**
- Cleanse the fractured tile with Radiance Shield buff

- An already fractured tile hit with a second Curse of Anathema curse activation becomes a Cursed Purple Tile instantly
- Players inside a fractured tile receive stacking slow debuff (Nerzatum's Fracture) that binds and deals major damage after 4 stacks
