# Colossal Coliseum

![Nerzatum Boss](/images/4-star/colossal-coliseum/nerzatum-boss.png)

## Jobs

- **Tank**: Lead Nerzatum over red orbs to reduce its stacked defense
- **Runner**: Reveal hidden tiles while avoiding Belmore to knock down Nerzatum
- **Tile Blockers (2)**: Run to purple tiles to block charging ghosts

## TL;DR

- Players stay near the tank during roll dodges to generate red orbs
- Tank runs Nerzatum over orbs to reduce its shield buff stacks, increasing damage taken
- Runner reveals hidden tiles while avoiding Belmore
- Other players avoid stacking purple circles while waiting to claim hidden tiles as they're revealed
- Damage output alternates between high and low intervals depending on whether Nerzatum is knocked down or has low shield stacks
