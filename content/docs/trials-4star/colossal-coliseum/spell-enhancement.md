**What**
- The power of the pattern enhances Nerzatum and Belmore
- Increases Nerzatum's damage dealt and decreases its damage taken
- Increases Belmore's Movement Speed

**Solution**
- Remove stacks by running Nerzatum over red orbs or causing Nerzatum to collapse

**Penalty**
- Each stack reduces damage dealt to Nerzatum by roughly 10%

> [!WARNING]
