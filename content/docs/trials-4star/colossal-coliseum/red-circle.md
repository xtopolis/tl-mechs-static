# Red Circle

{{< youtube STdsfzRPeuo >}}

**When**
- During main mechanic

**What**
- A random player (except tank) receives the Twisted Red Eye debuff
- Belmore chases this player until it touches them, or all hidden tiles are claimed

**Solution**
- Run around the board examining tiles without letting Belmore touch you

**Penalty**
- Belmore touching you will most likely wipe the group
- Failing to find all marks will most likely wipe the group

*Running an efficient pattern maximizes coverage and reduces time to find all hidden tiles*
