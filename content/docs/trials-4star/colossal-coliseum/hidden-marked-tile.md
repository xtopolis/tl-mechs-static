# Hidden Mark Tiles

{{< youtube r0_Jm0rB4hQ >}}

**When**
- During the hidden tile mech

**What**
- Hidden marked tiles are temporarily revealed by the Twisted Red Eye runner

**Solution**
- Reveal all 3 hidden marks by running over them
- Players with Curse of Anathema (purple circles) must claim the revealed marks by standing on them

**Penalty**
- Failing to reveal and claim all marks causes Nerzatum to deal significant or deadly group damage

*A revealed tile is only visible for a few seconds, but can still be claimed after it goes invisible again.*

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> Once a mark has been claimed by a cursed player, it becomes a black outline. A cursed player can safely remain on it without fracturing it, even while still cursed
