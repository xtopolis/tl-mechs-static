# Dodge Roll

{{< youtube hpCb101e9Bk >}}

**When**
- During Nerzatum's normal rotation

**What**
- Nerzatum performs slow and fast dodge roll attacks

**Solution**
- Dodge roll successfully to generate red orbs

**Penalty**
- A purple orb is generated instead
- 3 seconds reduced healing received

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> Stay stacked together so orbs spawn in roughly the same area, making it easier for the tank to lead Nerzatum over them

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> The fast roll rears up on hind legs immediately, while the slow roll wiggles first
