# Orbs

{{< youtube Ro71y5YLaWU >}}

**When**
- When a dodge roll occurs

**What**
- Orbs spawn based on players eligible for the roll (purple indicator)

**Solution**
- Dodge roll successfully to spawn a red orb, 1 per player who dodged

**Penalty**
- Failing your roll causes a purple orb to spawn instead

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> Stack together when dodge rolling to make the orbs spawn near each other, making it easier for the tank to acquire them
