# Towers

**When**
- After the last dodge roll in Fear

**What**
- Towers spawn in most of the tower spawn points
- Normal towers have two phases: Unstable, and Stable 
- Lightning towers have four phases: Shield Blue, Shield Yellow, Unstable, Stable
- All towers turn into Blocking Towers if they are Stable before the boss jumps back to the center 

**Solution**
- Normal: Interact with Unstable towers to stabilize them
- Lightning:
  - Shielded Towers with Blue Orb above it: bring a blue orb into the tower
  - Shielded Towers with Yellow Orb above it: bring a yellow orb into the tower
  - Then stabilize it like normal
- Blocking Towers:
  - Blue: Perform a roll dodge inside the blue circle around the tower while it's attacking
  - Red: Perform a normal block inside the blue circle around the tower while it's attacking

**Penalty**
- Failing to unlock each tower stage in time causes them to explode, wiping the raid

_Unstable tower, interact with it!_

_Stabilized tower, leave alone until it changes to a Blocking tower_

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> You have around 20 seconds per tower phase to change them to the next, or stable phase.

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> You don't need to hit Perfects with doing the blocking tower mechs. Defense is fine!

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> Two players can interact with the same tower to stabilize it faster. Don't mix opposite color circles though!

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> Lightning pillars always spawn in positions 1, 3, 4, 6, 7... where 1 is the tower to the left of the entrance, moving clockwise.
