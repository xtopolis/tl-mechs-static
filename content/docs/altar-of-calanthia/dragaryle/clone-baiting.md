# Clone Baiting

**When**
- Normal pattern: After green lines
- Tower pattern: After fear, when towers spawn

**What**
- Two clones spawn in adjacent corners at the edge of the arena
- The clones mark and target the player(s) furthest away from them with a red number
- The clones shoot a blue line directly towards their targeted player

**Solution**
- Normal: Have four players stand out a little further than the rest of the players to guarantee targeting
- Towers: Have the players move to the edge of the arena so that they remain the furthest out while others are interacting with the towers

**Penalty**
- Lines that are not properly placed can wipe the raid, or make it more difficult
