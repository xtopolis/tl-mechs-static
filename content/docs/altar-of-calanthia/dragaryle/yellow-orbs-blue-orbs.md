# Blue/Yellow Orbs

**When**
- Under 50% boss HP, going into Fear phase

**What**
- Many Yellow Orbs spawn around the boss before fear, or near players attacked during Fear blocks
- Few Blue Orbs spawn around the arena during Fear blocks
- Orbs move when hit by boss Q block attacks, or from player attacks

**Solution**
- Yellow Orbs move away from you when attacked, move them to Yellow Orb pillars
- Blue Orbs move towards you when attacked, move them to Blue Orb pillars

**Penalty**
- All Orbs can apply Lightning stacks to you, causing increasing DoT based on your stacks
- Blue Orbs take damage from players, taking too much damage causes them to explode and wipe the raid

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> Keeping the boss in the center, and stopping attacks when Yellow Orbs spawn has the best chance of keeping them evenly spread out in the arena

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> Assign ranged players to deal with Blue Orbs since they can often stand on a tower and auto attack them towards themselves

> [!WARNING]
> **Caution**
> If you see a Blue Orb under the boss, have everyone stop attacking and have one player pull it away so it doesn't explode from splash damage
