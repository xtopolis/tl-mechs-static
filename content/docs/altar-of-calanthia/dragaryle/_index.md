> [!TIP]
> **Tank Tips**
>  - Face boss north consistently
>  - Bait green lines north away from pillar locations
>  - Maintain 2 lines between each "eye" mech (can fit 3 but 2 is safer)
>  - Switch positions after baiting lines
>  - Dash to opposite side during transitions to avoid cages
>  - During totem phase, step back slightly before first block/dash to position boss for jump mechanic
>  - After jump, bait lines toward empty totem side, then walk around lines back to middle for Rancorwood
