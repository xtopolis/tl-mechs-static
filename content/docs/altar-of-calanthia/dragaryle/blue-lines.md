# Blue Lines

**When**
- When two blue clones spawn on the diagonals, after they mark their targets

**What**
- Two blue clones of Dragaryle appear at either of the 4 corners, adjacent to each other
- They each mark a target by placing a number above the target player's head
- Shortly after the clone shoots a blue line from its body directly to the player

**Solution**
- Have four players stand furthest from the boss to bait lines
- Bait lines in between tower spawn points, ideally diagonal corners
- Dodge roll

**Penalty**
- Poor line placement can wipe the raid
- Missing the dodge roll is minimal damage, but will knock you back

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> Once you have the red number above your head, run up to the boss as you dodge to have an easier Eye mech
