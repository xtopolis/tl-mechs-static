# Rancorwood

**When**
- After towers are initialized, when the boss jumps back to the center
- After 2 rounds of clone baiting

**What**
- The arena space beyond the towers to the edge becomes covered in a sandstorm
- The boss sends out 3 dodge rolls in a row with various parts of the remaining space covered by the attack, in circular shapes emanating from the boss

**Solution**
- Dodge roll each time

**Penalty**
- Missing a dodge roll will cause you to become caged

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> Of the 3 circular patterns he attacks with, one of them will always leave a safe area. It will either be a safe ring near the towers, or the first circle can be only outside in the sandstorm. Either way, most times you will only need to roll twice.
