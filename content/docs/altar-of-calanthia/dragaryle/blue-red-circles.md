# Color Circles

**When**
- After the final dodge roll of Fear phase

**What**
- All players are randomly assigned Blue or Red circles

**Solution**
- Keep circles of opposite colors from overlapping
- Ideally separate them to opposite sides of same colors

**Penalty**
- Mixing circle colors will cause petrification stacks to rapidly be applied
- Reaching 30 stacks creates a cage with 100,000 HP
