# Eye Mech

**When**
- Directly after clone baiters shoot their lines

**What**
- The boss places an Eye icon above the player who is currently furthest from the boss
- If the player is too far: the boss will jump AWAY from the marked player, and then shoot two green lines at that player
- If the player is close (roughly < 10m): the boss will jump upwards towards the player, then do a spinning attack (dodge roll)

**Solution**
- Keep all players within 10-15m of the boss
- Have the player with the eye run to the boss as soon as the mark appears

**Penalty**
- If the player is too far, the boss may move from the center which can make the following mechs more difficult, as well as placing additional green lines
