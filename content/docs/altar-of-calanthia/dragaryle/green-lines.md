# Green Lines

**When**
- During the normal attack pattern
- During Eye mech if the player is too far

**What**
- The boss shoots green lines towards the targeted player

**Solution**
- The green lines come at regular patterns, dodge roll and/or place them appropriately

**Penalty**
- Green lines that are on tower spawn points when towers spawn cause the raid to wipe
- Players who stand in green lines gain petrification stacks rapidly
