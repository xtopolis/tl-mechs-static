# Crystals

**When**
- After Slam/Swipes with safe area

**What**
- Players will be feared away from boss
- Some players will get a Crystal growing over their head
- The Crystal will drop after a few seconds
- After she does a breath attack, Crystals will begin a timed radius explosion

**Solution**
- Players should place the crystals spaced out near the boss so that they are close enough for players to run and hide to
- Hide behind remaining crystals for breath attack, then move to safe area

**Penalty**
- If two crystals are placed too close to each other, they will explode and deal significant damage
