# Detonators
> _Possessed Destroyers_

{{< youtube _js-wrZunx8 >}}

**When**
- Around 60% with screen text: _"Calanthia fills your body with condensed energy"_

**What**
- Calanthia sucks players towards her and spawns 12 shadow realm doors
- All players receive a timed detonation circle
- Each doorway can only be used by one player
- A player is targeted for a delayed dodge roll laser
- Inside the realm are two minibosses with 27m HP, one on each side

**Solution**
- Everyone enters the shadow realm using their own door
- 4 players must surround each miniboss to kill it with their circles (7million damage per cicle to miniboss)
- Leave the realm (see caution below)

**Penalty**
- If either miniboss fails to die, Calanthia wipes the raid

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> Circles do 10-15k damage to the the player and any other players inside the radius. If you overlap circles you will take damage from each one. You can position around the miniboss without overlapping other players, but having two players stack on each other is doable, healer permitting.

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> The minibosses will aggro to heals, etc. It's best to have someone on each side aggro them to hold them in place

> [!INFO]
> **Info**
> The closest person to the boss who hasn't yet entered the portal gets targeted by the delayed laser

> [!WARNING]
> **Caution**
> Circles may visually disappear, but they are still there

> [!WARNING]
> **Caution**
> Leaving the realm: If you did the 60% hand mech successfully before starting this mech, you will have time to Normal block and then leave the realm. If you did not destroy the hand before this mech, you will need to run to boss to avoid Slam/Swipe mech instead, then leave during Fear/Crystals
