# Zombies

**When**
- During Fear Crystals phase

**What**
- A horde of zombies spawn in the shadow realm

**Solution**
- Send 1-2 players in to kill them
- Use Roen (from shadow realm) if it's available
- Leave the shadow realm as soon as the block hits to minimize stacks

**Penalty**
- Any zombies still alive at the end of Crystals when the boss starts _absorbing chaos imbued summons_ add stacks. Boss stacks cause her to do more damage, and take less damage

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> Use a healer on each side to pull zombie aggro (via heals). Have a dps on each side kill as many zombies around their respective healer as they can.
