# Piano

**When**
- After Fear/Crystals phase, with voiceline: _"Stand down!"_

**What**
- Calanthia summons 7 red orbs spaced along her arena's edge
- Calanthia does a knockback pushing players into the air, and red orbs randomly into the arena
- The arena gets covered with 15 black lines and one 1 empty safe line
- A few seconds after red orbs explode, purple blasts will show up above each black line
- The sequence will be: blasts fire, lines shift, blasts fire, lines shift, blasts fire

**Solution**
- During the airborne knockback, look at Calanthia's eyes. The glowing one indicates the direction to move
- Take your time getting safely into position, the lasers don't fire until a few seconds after the red orbs explode

**Penalty**
- Being inside a red circle as it explodes is massive damage that will kill most players
- Being inside a red circle AFTER it explodes and is just a puddle is minor tick damage
- Being hit by a laser in a black column will cause a knockback off the edge that will most likely kill you

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> Position yourself halfway between the middle of the safe area and the edge of the direction you want to go. Do not start too close to the direction you want to go as the collision is buggy

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> If you must be inside a red orb as it pops, you can block the damage with Q

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> After the mech ends, it's recommended to heal up and add mitigation before the next mech starts (tethers)
