# Orbs

**When**
- 90%, with voiceline: _"Who wants to die first?"_

**What**
- 4 players pulled with the same predictability as phase 1
- The 4 players who are pulled have to group up for "Eye" mech

**Solution**
- The Eye mech players group up in each 4 circle to verify if it's real
- The 4 circle will trigger an animation depending on if it's real or fake (vertical red line = fake)
- The rest of the players fill the remaining 3/3/2 circles

**Penalty**
- Anyone not in a correctly filled or verified circle will die

_This simple animation means the 4-circle is real, stay!_

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> The circles only appear in two patterns, you can assign roles ahead of time

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> Players who are not part of Eye mech should focus on killing the big Destruction Zombies that spawn when the last person is freed before going to their circles.
