# Feathers Stun

**When**
- After piano, with voiceline: _"No use running away!"_
- Stun with screen text: _"Calanthia is radiating a powerful light"_

**What**
- Deadly marker animations will appear above players heads
- She will stun anyone whose character is facing the boss with a blinding light
- She will then begin raining down feathers on players

**Solution**
- Spread out lightly and keep moving, feathers fall with a slight delay before hitting the player and can mostly be avoided
- Make your character stop attacking and turn 180degree facing away from boss to avoid stun

**Penalty**
- Stunned while feathers are damaging you if you don't look away

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> You don't have to run far away from boss, as long as your character isn't facing her

> [!WARNING]
> **Caution**
> Ensure your CHARACTER, not just your camera, is looking away from the boss. Untarget, morph, run backwards
