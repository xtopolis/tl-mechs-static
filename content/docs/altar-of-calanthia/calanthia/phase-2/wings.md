# Wings

**When**
- Below 20%, after the fast Q block

**What**
- 6 tethers appear (3 on each side) connected to Calanthia's wings
- Completing the dps check does bonus damage of around 9% to the boss

**Solution**
- Players interact with the tether and run it away from the boss to the stake
- Players wait near the boss to get launched in the air when she falls to the ground and land on their wing orb
- Kill the wing orb within the time limit

**Penalty**
- Bonus damage is not applied

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> Interacting with a tether gives a slow debuff. Use a movement skill or have a healer use a cleanse skill to move faster

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> The boss has Damage Reduction during this phase, save your skills for the orbs
