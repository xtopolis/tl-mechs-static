# Mirrors

**When**
- At 75% and 35% interrupt mechs

**What**
- Initial spawn of 4 red mirrors, and 1 purple
- Purples spawn clockwise every 2-3 seconds (7 more times)
- Dodge roll 5 seconds after mirrors spawn, then twice more (7-8 seconds apart)
- First purple mirror fires first, then clockwise
- Red mirrors trigger a few seconds after purple beam targets them


**Solution**
- Move to gold line at flat edge of arena
- Keep your back to one of the mirrors behind you
- Dodge roll and move into the lane of the mirror after it fires

**Penalty**
- Missing a roll will knock you down for a few seconds
- If you are too close to the edge, you can get knocked off
- If you are caught in a beam as it fires, you will die

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> Once the beam animation shows up, you can walk into it while it's still firing without taking damage

> [!WARNING]
> **Caution**
> If the Tank (person with aggro) does not get back to the boss before the last beam finishes firing, they will get pulled and choked for huge damage

**Patterns**
- No matter which side you choose, the last beams will be one of 3 patterns
1. Free - you can move up to the boss safely, with the last beam going diagonally across the boss
2. Diagonal Purple - You can move up slightly, waiting for the diagonal purple to cast
3. Red - There will be a red beam close in front of you and a purple beam that overlaps the side closest to the boss. The tank should step halfway onto the red, then dash after the purple fires and before the red fires to get back to the boss.
