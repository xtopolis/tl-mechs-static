# Mirrors

**When**
- At 75% and 35% interrupt mechs

**What**
- Initial spawn of 4 red mirrors, and 1 purple
- Purples spawn clockwise from first purple in next empty slot every 3 seconds (7 more times)
- Dodge roll 5 seconds after mirrors spawn, then twice more (7-8 seconds apart)
- First purple mirror fires first, then clockwise
- Red mirrors trigger a few seconds after purple beam targets them


**Solution**
- Move to gold line at flat edge of arena
- Keep your back to one of the mirrors behind you
- Dodge roll and move into the lane of the mirror after it fires

**Penalty**
- Missing a roll will knock you down for a few seconds
- If you are too close to the edge, you can get knocked off
- If you are caught in a beam as it fires, you will die

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> Once the beam firing animation shows up, you can walk into it while it's still firing without taking damage

> [!WARNING]
> **Caution**
> If the Tank (person with aggro) does not get back to the boss before the last beam finishes firing, they will get pulled and choked for huge damage. The person with aggro needs to be within 15m before the last laser fires

## Patterns

> _All explanations are from the perspective of running South (towards stairs)_
> _Numbering is top left corner = 1, top edge left side = 2 (see simulator below)_

### 3 Red

{{< youtube -wiGWz7JQHs >}}

- Reds spawn at 1,3,5 (and 9), such that you can see "three reds" in front of you
- Start Left, then Right, Right (angled purple)
- Getting back: Tank should run up on Right side as last dodge roll is coming (left vertical purple is firing), and cross to Calanthia's Southwest corner between the Red and Purple that begin to telegraph they are firing (cross the angled purple before it shows up)

### Late Red

{{< youtube DGXMRGU_FFc >}}

- Reds spawn at 3,7,9,11 (most are behind you)
- Start Right, then Left, Left (sneak up to the Red)
- Getting back: After the 3rd dodge roll and horizontal purple fires, move up a bit to the red edge that's telegraphing, as soon as it does the firing animation, run to the boss (there will be an angled purple on your left, be careful)

### 4 Free

{{< youtube 8fBR0JqVjWY >}}

- Reds spawn at 4,6,8,12 (basically just a single Red at top right corner)
- Start Right, then Right, Left (free to run up)
- Getting back: After second dodge roll, there will be one more purple firing on left side, then everyone is free to run up almost, but not all the way to boss (and last dodge roll happens)
