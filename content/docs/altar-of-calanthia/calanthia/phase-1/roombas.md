# Roombas

**When**
- After tethers with voiceline: _"Embrace your death!"_

**What**
- 10 closest players are targeted to receive roombas
- The roombas spawn in groups of 5, a few seconds apart

**Solution**
- Kite the roombas in a circle, leaving room for other players
- The Tank should kite their roombas around the boss in a circle so as to not get out of range of the boss

**Penalty**
- Large amounts of damage ticks rapidly if hit by roombas

_These appear just before the AOE blast of roombas about to come out_

_When this AOE blast happens, the closest group of players are target locked and can start moving away_

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> The first group of roombas are "assigned" right after she does the purple aoe circle attack a few seconds before they appear. The first group of closest players can step back at this time

> [!WARNING]
> **Caution**
> Roombas leave puddles when they stop chasing doing tick damage to anyone who steps in them
