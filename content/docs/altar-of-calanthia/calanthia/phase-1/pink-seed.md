# Pink Seed

**When**
- During Corner Clones phase (right after roombas)

**What**
- The four players closest to the boss (even if Tank) will get a pink seed above their head
- After 5s the seeds will drop onto the floor into large black puddles and explode killing anyone in the circle who doesn't block

**Solution**
- The four players should stack together to minimize the circle coverage and block at the same time

**Penalty**
- Anyone inside the circle who doesn't block will die

_As soon as the black puddle appears, Block!_

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> Have four players stack on the boss to get seeds. Have the tank stay a few steps away to avoid this mech as they will be doing dodge rolls right before this

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> The players with the seeds will have a debuff that counts down, after which the seeds drop into puddles
