# 2 Circle

{{< youtube gjWRVB3OZ6g allowFullScreen >}}

**When**
- During Roombas assignment phase

**What**
- A Healers will always get a circle around them with the number 2 above their heads

**Solution**
- Another player must enter the circle so that the total number of players inside is 2
- The players should be prepared to block damage, clear the block, and then block again

**Penalty**
- Failure to complete the mech/block damage will kill the player(s)
- The circle will then jump to the nearest player and kill them too if they don't block, repeating
