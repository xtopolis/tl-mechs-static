# Corner Clones

**When**
- After Roombas phase

**What**
- Four clones will spawn in the corners in pairs, with a small delay between the second spawn
- The player closest to each respective corner will be targeted by the nearest clone
- The Tank will also get lasers from Calanthia at the same time

**Solution**
- Stay in the far corner until the laser locks on and prepares to fire
- Walk out towards the boss, or dodge roll the mech

**Penalty**
- The laser will knock you down if you fail the dodge roll

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> You can move slightly foward and back until you see when the laser locks on (stops tracking) and then just walk out, towards the boss
