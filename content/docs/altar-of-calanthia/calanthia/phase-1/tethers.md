**When**
- After lightning mech with voiceline: _"There's no point in resisting!"_

**What**
- Two groups of three players are chained to each other (Tank excluded)
- While chained, the players take tick damage, as well as anyone touching the tether

**Solution**
- Players need to spread out so that the length of the tethers between connected players is greater than (TBD) meters

**Penalty**
- The players and anyone inside continuously take tick damage

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> When you get pulled, you can roll dodge to block the initial damage
