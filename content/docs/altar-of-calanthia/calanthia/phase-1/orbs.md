# Orbs

**When**
- At 90% with voiceline: _"It's too late to run!"_

**What**
- Players will get pulled to Orbs and hoisted, taking increased stacks
- After all players are freed, circles appear on the ground with 2-4 Orbs above them
- You have roughly 20 seconds to solve the mech

**Solution**
- The number of players in each circle must exactly match the number of Orbs above it

**Penalty**
- Players not correctly in circles will be killed by Calanthia's bomb

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> Circles locations will appear on the gold triangle designs of the bosses octagon. They will either be in front of the corners, or rotated by one triangle. Choose which direction your team will rotate ahead of time.

> **Tip**
> If your group's circle has a 2, indicating a flex, the circle directly across from you (facing the boss) will be a 4.
