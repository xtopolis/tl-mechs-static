# Aura/Stacks

**When**
- Active _most_ of the timer during combat

**What**
- The boss radiates an aura circle extending to the edge of their octagon
- Players gain stacks of the respective fire or ice debuff, 1 stack every second

**Solution**
- Keep stacks under 30-40 ish depending on your team
- Move to the other boss' aura to remove your existing debuff stack immediately
- Stacks last 20s since last refresh before falling off

**Penalty**
- Damage over time, increasing with stacks
- Higer stacks cause you to take additional damage from Jericho Missiles
