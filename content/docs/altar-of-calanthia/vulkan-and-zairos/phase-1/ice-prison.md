# (Ice) Prison

**When**
- During normal rotation

**What**
- The tank will get a number over their head and a circle around them
- Shortly after they will be frozen in place

**Solution**
- The same number of players as the number shown on the tanks head must enter the circle and wait until the tank is free

**Penalty**
- The tank remains frozen
- The tank gets an aoe damage ring around them (?)

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> Be sure to have players leave the tank's circle first and then re-enter it to ensure the game recognizes enough players being inside to solve it

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> It's best to stack together in case there are two prisons, so that you can solve both at the same time
