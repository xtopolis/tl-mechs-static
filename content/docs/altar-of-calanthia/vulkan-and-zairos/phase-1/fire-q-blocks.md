# (Fire) Q Blocks

**When**
- During normal rotation (usually after tethers/wave)

**What**
- Vulkan does a telegraphed Q block that expands each time

**Solution**
- Q block repeatedly

**Penalty**
- Decent damage taken (2 hits most squishies)

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> There are 3 ticks of damage, but only 2 Q block indicators. if you have a long block, you can hold it for the first 2, then clear it and block again. The extra tick is in between the block indicators

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> You can walk out of range of the Q blocks, mostly the last one. Keep in mind that it does extend past the octagon area.
