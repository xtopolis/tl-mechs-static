# Player Tethers

**When**
- At the 90, 70, 20 interrupt health percentages

**What**
- The boss does a whoosing gesture, applying a debuff onto players within their respective octagons
- Players must cleanse their debuff before the Wave comes

**Solution**
- Players who receive the debuff are matched with players from the opposite boss and must physically touch to cleanse their debuff and gain protection from the Wave

**Penalty**
- They will die when the wave comes

> [!TIP]
> **Tip**
> Place pins vertically in the middle of the arena. Have one boss' side line up, and the other side run to them to avoid confusion and ensure every partner is matched. If a player keeps dying despite doing the mech, have them be the person who waits for the partner to come to them (lines up).
