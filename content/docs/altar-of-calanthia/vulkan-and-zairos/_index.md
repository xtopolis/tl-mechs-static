During Phase 1, each party engages bosses simultaneously. Parties should try to match their DPS so that they hit the interrupt percentages at the same time, ensuring they have plenty of time to match tethers. During Phase 2, players should be grouped within their respective parties, making sure to solve or avoid mechs, and be on the appropriate side during Punches to get their protection matching buff.
